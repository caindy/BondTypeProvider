This is an attempt to reboot the (Bond Type Provider)[https://github.com/microsoft/bond/tree/fsharp].

*License info*: most of the code that matters here is Copyright Microsoft and you should look at the Bond repo. I'm trying to clean-up and refactor the original code a bit, so I haven't sprinkled all the appropriate copyright notices around, stay tuned.

This isn't a fork because I wanted to start with Project Scaffold and use paket.
The original Bond branch used the C# Runtime NuGet packages for this work, and I believe the project works better as a standalone effort.

# Goals
[ ] Multi-targetting
[ ] Fully support Bond types (lot to do here)
[ ] Generate types from Bond IDL
